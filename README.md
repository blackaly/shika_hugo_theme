## üìù Content Creation

### Multilingual Content

Shika theme supports both English and Arabic content. Here's how to create content for both languages:

#### Creating Posts

For **English** posts:
```bash
# Create a new post in English
hugo new content/en/posts/my-post.md
```

```yaml
---
title: "My English Post Title"
date: 2023-04-07T10:00:00-05:00
tags: ["blog", "example"]
image: "/img/my-featured-image.jpg"
draft: false
---

Your English content here.
```

For **Arabic** posts:
```bash
# Create a new post in Arabic
hugo new content/ar/posts/my-post.md
```

```yaml
---
title: "ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÇÿßŸÑÿ© ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©"
date: 2023-04-07T10:00:00-05:00
tags: ["ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ©", "ŸÖÿ´ÿßŸÑ"]
image: "/img/my-featured-image.jpg"
draft: false
---

ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠ÿ™ŸàŸâ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä ŸáŸÜÿß.
```

#### Creating Tutorials

For **English** tutorials:
```bash
# Create a new tutorial in English
hugo new content/en/tutorials/getting-started.md
```

```yaml
---
title: "Getting Started Guide"
date: 2023-04-07T10:00:00-05:00
tags: ["tutorial", "beginners"]
image: "/img/tutorial-image.jpg"
weight: 1
draft: false
---

Your English tutorial content here.
```

For **Arabic** tutorials:
```bash
# Create a new tutorial in Arabic
hugo new content/ar/tutorials/getting-started.md
```

```yaml
---
title: "ÿØŸÑŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿØÿ°"
date: 2023-04-07T10:00:00-05:00
tags: ["ÿØÿ±ÿ≥", "ŸÖÿ®ÿ™ÿØÿ¶ŸäŸÜ"]
image: "/img/tutorial-image.jpg"
weight: 1
draft: false
---

ŸÖÿ≠ÿ™ŸàŸâ ÿßŸÑÿØÿ±ÿ≥ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© ŸáŸÜÿß.
```

> **Note**: The `weight` parameter determines the order in which tutorials appear on the page. Lower values appear first.

### Translation Management

For the best user experience, create matching content in both languages:

1. When creating a new post or tutorial, create both English and Arabic versions.
2. Keep the same filename in both language directories for easier management.
3. Use the same `weight` parameter in both language versions to maintain consistent ordering.

Example of corresponding files:
- `content/en/posts/welcome.md`
- `content/ar/posts/welcome.md`

## üß© Shortcodes

### Split Article Shortcode

This theme includes a powerful split-article shortcode that allows you to create side-by-side comparisons:

```
{{< split-article 
    left="### Left Side Content"
    right="### Right Side Content"
    leftPoint="Left Label" 
    rightPoint="Right Label"
    note="A connecting note between the two sides"
    direction="horizontal"
>}}
```

For detailed documentation and examples, see the [Split Article Documentation](/tutorials/theme-documentation/).

## üé® Customization

### CSS Customization

The theme's appearance can be customized by modifying the CSS files in `static/css/`:

- `style.css`: Core styles
- `home.css`: Home page styles
- `article.css`: Article page styles
- `list_article.css`: Listing page styles

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Theme Not Working**: Make sure the theme name is set to "Shika" (case-sensitive) in your config.toml
- **Missing Styles**: Check that all CSS files are properly loaded in the head partial
- **Images Not Displaying**: Ensure image paths are correct and files exist in the static directory
- **Language Switching**: Verify that your multilingual configuration is correct in config.toml
