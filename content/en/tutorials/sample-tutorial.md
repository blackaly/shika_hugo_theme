# Beginner's Guide to HTML

HTML is the fundamental language used to create web pages. In this tutorial, we'll learn the basics you need to start creating your own web pages.

## What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the standard markup language used to create web pages.

## Basic HTML Document Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Basic Elements

### Headings

HTML provides six levels of headings:

```html
<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
```

### Paragraphs

You can create paragraphs using the `<p>` element:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```
