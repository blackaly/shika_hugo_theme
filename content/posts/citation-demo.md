# Citation System Demo

This post demonstrates the side-margin citation system integrated into the Shika theme.

## Academic Citations Made Easy

When writing scholarly or technical content, it's common to need to reference external sources. The Shika theme now includes a citation system that displays references in the right margin of your content.

Let's see a simple example. According to Smith et al.{{< cite num="1" authors="Smith, J., Jones, M., & Davis, K." title="The Impact of Modern Technology on Society" details="Journal of Social Sciences, 2023, 45(2), 123-145" link="https://example.com/journal/smith2023" >}}, the integration of technology into daily life has accelerated dramatically in the past decade. This claim is further supported by research from Johnson{{< cite num="2" authors="Johnson, R." title="Digital Transformation and Cultural Change" details="Tech Review Press, 2022" link="https://example.com/books/johnson2022" >}}, who found that smartphone usage has increased by over 200% since 2015.

## Multiple Citations in Context

When discussing multiple sources, the citation system makes it easy to keep track of references. For instance, the concept of digital minimalism proposed by Newport{{< cite num="3" authors="Newport, C." title="Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World" details="Portfolio, 2019" >}} suggests that we should be more intentional about our technology use. This idea contrasts with the "attention economy" model described by Harris{{< cite num="4" authors="Harris, T." title="The Attention Economy and How Tech Companies Capture Our Time" details="Center for Humane Technology, 2021" link="https://humanetech.com/papers/attention-economy" >}}, where technological platforms are explicitly designed to maximize user engagement regardless of the content's value.

## Advanced Usage

The citation system also works well with complex paragraphs containing multiple references. For example, in a comprehensive review of remote work effectiveness, Zhang and colleagues{{< cite num="5" authors="Zhang, L., Brown, S., & Martinez, A." title="Remote Work Productivity in Post-Pandemic Environments" details="Journal of Organizational Behavior, 2023, 12(3), 87-104" >}} found that properly equipped home offices yielded productivity increases of 13-22% across various industries. However, Chen{{< cite num="6" authors="Chen, W." title="The Social Cost of Remote Work" details="Sociology Today, 2022, 34(1), 56-78" >}} cautions that these gains may come at the expense of workplace social capital and spontaneous collaboration that traditionally occurs in office settings.
