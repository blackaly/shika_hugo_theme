# Margin Citations Demo

This page demonstrates how citations appear in the margin area, completely outside the article container.

## Margin Citation Example

When writing academic or technical content, it's often helpful to place citations outside the main text flow. According to Smith{{< cite num="1" authors="Smith, J." title="Margin Citations in Academic Writing" details="Journal of Typography, 2022, 14(3), 45-67" >}}, margin citations improve readability by keeping the main text uncluttered while providing necessary reference information to readers who want it.

Research by Johnson and Williams{{< cite num="2" authors="Johnson, R. & Williams, T." title="The Psychology of Document Layout" details="Cognitive Science Review, 2023, 5(2), 112-134" link="https://example.com/margin-citations" >}} found that readers report higher satisfaction and better retention when citations are placed in margins rather than as footnotes or endnotes.

## Multi-Citation Paragraphs

For paragraphs with multiple citations, the margin placement becomes especially valuable. In a comprehensive analysis of reading patterns, Chen{{< cite num="3" authors="Chen, L." title="Reading Patterns in Digital Media" details="Digital Publishing Quarterly, 2022, 7(1), 23-41" >}} found that readers typically process inline citations as interruptions to their reading flow. This finding was supported by eye-tracking studies conducted by Patel{{< cite num="4" authors="Patel, K." title="Eye-Tracking Studies of Academic Papers" details="Human-Computer Interaction Journal, 2023, 19(4), 378-395" >}} that showed readers' eyes often pause and jump backward when encountering traditional citation formats.

## Margin Notes vs. Footnotes

The concept of margin notes dates back to medieval manuscripts, where scholars would annotate texts in the generous margins provided. According to Wilson{{< cite num="5" authors="Wilson, H." title="The History of Book Margins" details="Publishing History, 2021, 32(3), 89-107" >}}, this practice evolved over centuries but was constrained by printing technologies that favored footnotes and endnotes for cost-saving purposes.

Digital publishing has revitalized margin citations by removing the space constraints of physical printing. Martinez{{< cite num="6" authors="Martinez, A." title="Digital Publishing and Academic Citation Formats" details="Journal of Scholarly Publishing, 2023, 11(2), 56-72" link="https://example.org/digital-margins" >}} argues that digital formats should adopt margin citation as the standard to improve both readability and academic rigor.
