# Margin Citation Example

This article demonstrates how margin citations appear outside the article container.

## Simple Example

According to Smith{{< cite num="1" authors="Smith, J." title="Margin Citations in Academic Writing" details="Journal of Typography, 2022, 14(3), 45-67" >}}, margin citations improve readability by keeping the main text uncluttered.

## Multiple Citations

For paragraphs with multiple citations, margin placement becomes even more valuable. Research by Chen{{< cite num="2" authors="Chen, L." title="Reading Patterns in Digital Media" details="Digital Publishing Quarterly, 2022, 7(1), 23-41" >}} found that readers process inline citations as interruptions to their reading flow. This was supported by Patel{{< cite num="3" authors="Patel, K." title="Eye-Tracking Studies of Academic Papers" details="Human-Computer Interaction Journal, 2023, 19(4), 378-395" >}} who showed that readers' eyes often pause when encountering traditional citation formats.
